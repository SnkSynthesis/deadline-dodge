# Speed Logic

This circuitry controls the speed of the [lfsr-decoder-logic](../lfsr-decoder-logic/) and, in turn, how fast the rocks fall in the game. It is a modular feature that introduces three distinct speed levels.

When the player survives for a set amount of time without triggering any collision (i.e., without losing), the speed logic increases the speed at which rocks spawn and fall and making the game progressively harder.

## Operation

### Triggering the Speed Increase
An AND gate detects the LFSR state 1111 (inputs: Qa, Qb, Qc, Qd), which occurs at regular intervals. This output increments a mod-6 counter (74LS163N). Although the counter is designed to count up to 6, it is forced to jump to its maximum count (1111) in order to set the RCO pin high, triggering the next stage. The mod-6 counter was an arbitrary choice, which makes the game speed increase after the LFSR has reached state 1111, six times. 
# How the counter works 
The counter begins it count at 0001 and continues through 0011, at which time a NAND gates goes Low and triggers the LOAD on the counter to count 1100. Then the counter continues through its count and when it rolls over the RCO is triggered. 

### Speed Level Control
The next stage is another 74LS163N counter. Each time this counter is incremented, the game speed increases. After two speed increases, the counter locks at its highest setting so the final speed is maintained for the rest of the game.

### Speed Selection and Distribution
The counterâ€™s outputs are decoded with combinational logic to control a 74LS153 4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX).

The MUX selects between three clock inputs:
System clock (full speed),
Divide-by-2 clock,
Divide-by-4 clock.
The two divided clocks are generated from specific outputs of a counter driven by the system clock.

The MUX output determines the active game speed. This clock signal is fed back into the entire game so all elements operate in sync with the selected tempo.
