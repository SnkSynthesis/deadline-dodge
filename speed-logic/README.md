# Speed Logic

This circuitry controls the speed of the [lfsr-decoder-logic](../lfsr-decoder-logic/) and, in turn, how fast the rocks fall in the game. It is a modular feature that introduces three distinct speed levels.

When the player survives for a set amount of time without triggering the Collision Logic (i.e., without losing), the Speed Logic activates, increasing the game speed and making the game progressively harder.

Operation/
-Triggering the Speed Increase-
An AND gate detects the LFSR state 1111 (inputs: Qa, Qb, Qc, Qd), which occurs at regular intervals. This output increments a mod-6 counter (74LS163N). Although the counter is designed to count up to 6, it is forced to jump directly to its maximum count (1111). This sets the RCO pin high, triggering the next stage.

-Speed Level Control-
The next stage is another 74LS163N counter. Each time this counter is incremented, the game speed increases. After two speed increases, the counter locks at its highest setting so the final speed is maintained for the rest of the game.

-Speed Selection and Distribution-
The counterâ€™s outputs are decoded with combinational logic to control a 74LS153 4-to-1 multiplexer (MUX).

The MUX selects between three clock inputs:

System clock (full speed)
Divide-by-2 clock
Divide-by-4 clock
The two divided clocks are generated from specific outputs of a counter driven by the system clock.

The MUX output determines the active game speed. This clock signal is fed back into the entire game so all elements operate in sync with the selected tempo.
