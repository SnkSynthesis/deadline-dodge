The schematic shows the LFSR being decoded by a 3-8 decoder. 
3 of 4 taps are used on the LFSR so the falling rocks have a longer sequence, (See LFSR_Sequence.png). 
The decoder "chooses" a shift register column to send a rock down on each clock cycle. 
The image shows 2 of 8 shift registers, column F5 and column F7, (for the purpose of the example). 
The image demonstrates an example of the overall function and logic - not the full game.
